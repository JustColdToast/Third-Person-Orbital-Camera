# Third-Person-Orbital-Camera
Third Person Orbital Camera is a small demo I made in Unity3D featuring an animated character able to move in a 3D space, along with a third person camera that rotates around them.
The camera's position and facing can affect player movement as well: "W" will always move in the forward direction defined as the direction that the camera is facing.
